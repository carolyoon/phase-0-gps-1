What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I struggled with when to use a branch and when I should initialize a file or folder by using the "git init" command.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
I figured out when to use a branch and how to push it back up, and that the git init command is solely used when the file is not from the orginial repository.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? N/A

What still confuses you about Git?
I don't think I know enough to specify how I come across certain problems, but I main run into trouble when trying to push changes back up to GitHub repo.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? N/A
